There is increasing discourse in the literature and media on the greater mental load women take on in the running of a household than men. We use 2022 US General Social Survey data to test this theory by using self-reported worry as a proxy for mental load to quantify the gendered differences in mentalload across married individuals. First we show that when controlling for share of conspicuous household work, women are more worried than men. Next, we control for various socioeconomic, demographic, and mental health indicators, and find that women are, on average, 7% more worried in their day-to-day lives than men.
